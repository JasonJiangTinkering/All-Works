<p> Mia Watanabe is Samurai Ranger Sky, the Pink Samurai Ranger in Power Rangers Samurai. She is described as the "big sister" of the team, and is given the element of Sky to battle evil. Mia is a mature, optimistic big sister to the Power Rangers. She hoped that someday she would find her "Prince Charming", possibly hinting that it was Kevin or Jayden. She considers herself to be a great cook, but none of the other Rangers agree, save for Lauren, who adores her cooking. She is also very compassionate, showing sympathy to Dayu, a lady who got the short stick of things and was forced to serve Xandred with her husband to save her husband's life, and asked if she could return to her past self. In the episode "Forest for the Trees", Ji gives her the Beetle Disk. Mike becomes jealous that she got the Disk and not him. Mia later gives it to Mike, saying "he'll make better use of the Disk then I can". This shows the extreme extent that her kindness goes to, turning down power and honor in favor for her friends.
