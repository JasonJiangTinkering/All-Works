<p> Centuries ago in Japan, Nighlok monsters invaded our world, but samurai warriors defeated them with power symbols, passed down from parent to child.
  Today the evil Nighlok have risen once again and plan to flood the earth. Luckily, a new generation of heroes stand in their way. They are the Power Rangers Samurai" -Narrator
  The series starts with the rebirth of evil in the form of Xandred, the most powerful Nighlok. He wants to flood the Sanzu River into the human world so they can escape the nether. Octoroo, the stratagiser for Xandred, theorizes that if they scare the humans, their tears would fill up the river.
  As the seris progresses we start to learn about the generations of Power Rangers. The first generation of Power Rangers were given their morphers by the guardians because at the time evil was approching and the Power Rangers were needed to defend it. The first red ranger, before he died, created the seal that trapped Xandred and his minions to the netherworld. However the seal wasn't conplete which allowed his smaller minions to pass through rips between the two worlds. Because the seal wasn't complete, later on in the series we learn of Jaden's sister whom while Jaden borne the mantle of the red ranger protecting the world, she trained herself to be ready for the time where she was to cast a complete seal that would bind Xandred and his minions to the netherworld. However, the seal would only work if it was cast like the original, she had to cast it in front of Xandred in his weakened form.
