<p> Mike is Samurai Ranger Forest, the Green Samurai Ranger in Power Rangers Samurai. He loves video games and is a bit of a rebel. As Green Ranger, he pilots the Bear FoldingZord and controls the element of forest. Mike is a slacker who also likes hanging out with his friends. He is effective as a Ranger, though his sense of humor and lazy tendencies don't always line up with the ways of the Samurai. Mike first appeared when Mentor Ji's call to arms took out a cheeseburger that he was eating in the first episode "origins". He was revealed to be the Green Ranger, and soon proved that despite his slacking, he was a very capable fighter. Unlike the others' unwavering dedication, Mike had no problems stopping for a bite to eat, or putting his training on hold for fun. While this keeps him one of the more well-adjusted members of the Samurai team, it does show during battle, as he is commonly depicted as rushing in early, and being knocked out quickly. However, Mike has been shown to be a hard worker when he is motivated to do so, as he trained tirelessly to get strong enough to master the Beetle Disc in the episode "Forest for the Trees", however it is given to Mia instead of him. His training eventually pays off, and he earns the Beetle Disc to keep.
