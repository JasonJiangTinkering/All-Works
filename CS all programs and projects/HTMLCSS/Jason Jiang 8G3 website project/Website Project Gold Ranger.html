<p> Antonio Garcia is Samurai Ranger Light, the Gold Samurai Power Ranger in Power Rangers Samurai and Power Rangers Super Samurai. He is also my favorite charater. He can control the element of Light. He is also Jayden's childhood best friend. As the Gold Ranger, Antonio is the sixth Ranger of the Samurai Power Rangers, a fish seller, and a better cook than Mia. He also happens to be a childhood friend of Jayden, receiving the OctoZord from him and making a promise to see him again soon.
Antonio takes his role as the Gold Ranger with much enthusiasm and energy. He can be seen as Jayden's opposite, as he is as hyperactive and expressive, while Jayden is reserved and stoic. Antonio made his debut in Unexpected Arrival, he sent an anonymous letter to Jayden and the other Samurai Rangers, saying "See You Soon." The following day, Mia, Emily, Kevin, and Mike found out about the note, and later headed into battle. When the Rangers had trouble, Antonio appeared and Morphed into the Gold Samurai Power Ranger. In the following episode, he arrived at the Shiba House, but Ji didn't allow him to join the others initially due to the fact that Ji thought he didn't know the dangers of being a Samurai and did not get the required training. A short time later, though, he did become the 6th Samurai Power Ranger. Antonio became the tech expert of the group and managed to unlock the ClawZord, Black Box, LightZord, and SharkZord. In the episode Trading Places, Switchbeast, a Nighlok with the power to transport one's soul into an object, switches Antonio's soul into a fish. Antonio is shocked when he finds a cat about to eat him. Just right before the cat is about to take a bite, Switchbeast is defeated, and Antonio returns to his body. Antonio faints with shock. In the episode Something Fishy, Antonio has developed a fear of fish, which at one point during in battle, Antonio drops his Barracuda Blade, thinking it was a fish. The other Rangers try to help him, but fail to do so. As the rangers go into battle, Ji gives Antonio the LightZord, and Antonio manages to bring it back to life, giving the team a new Zord. Ji snaps him back into his senses by surprisingly forcing a piece of sushi into Antonio, which he eats with no problem.
