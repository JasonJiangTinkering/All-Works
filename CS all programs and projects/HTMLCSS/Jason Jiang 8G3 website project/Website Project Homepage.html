<p> Power Rangers Samurai is the eighteenth season of the American children's television series Power Rangers and in my opinion the best. It aired on February 7, 2011, making it the first to use the Saban name since the first half of Power Rangers: Wild Force. As with all Power Rangers programs, Power Rangers Samurai is based on one of the entries of the Super Sentai Series; in the case of Power Ranger Samurai, the source series is Samurai Sentai Shinkenger. Saban Brands have said, "the show will have a "brighter tone and gets an infusion of fun and comedy that wasn't present in seasons 16 and 17." There are 45 episodes to the Power Ranger Samerai series. Afterwards there is a few extra episodes connecting the Power Ranger Samerai to other series. After you are done watching the Power Ranger Samerai series I recommend Power Ranger Megaforce and Ninga Steel. I didn't like dino-charge as a child and I still don't like it today. Also there is a japanese version of Power Ranger Samerai called Samurai Sentai Shinkenger. It's the same thing but Samurai Sentai Shinkenger looks better because it was filmed in Japan which match the theme of the series. Additionaly one is in english and the other is in japanese.
