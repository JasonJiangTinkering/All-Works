#goal: make a program to determine what i can buy given amount of cash and the nyc sale tax
#use when im tryna leave the house so i know how much i can spend

x = float(input("How much money do u have"))
print(x/1.08875)


#what i learned
#spending money in nyc is expensive
#i gotta cut down my spending when i hang out
#gotta bring more food than i think i can eat because after working i am hungry
